# Exoplanet-Detection-using-Light-Curve

This project involves building a complete machine learning pipeline to classify exoplanet candidates using live data from NASA’s Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) dataset, accessed through the astroquery library. The workflow begins with retrieving real-time astronomical data, followed by preprocessing steps such as filtering valid entries, handling missing values using imputation, encoding classification labels (CONFIRMED = 1, others = 0), and selecting relevant numeric features. Two classification models—Random Forest and Logistic Regression—are trained using the preprocessed data, with hyperparameter tuning applied to the Random Forest model via GridSearchCV. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrices. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) is used to interpret feature importance and explain model predictions. The final system achieves high classification accuracy (up to 99%) and demonstrates the ability to automatically and accurately identify confirmed exoplanets from live NASA data, offering both performance and interpretability.
